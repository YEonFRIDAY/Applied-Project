# Applied-Project  
MSc applied project codes  
As the whole report is long enough, the code for this project has been uploaded here. Quantlib package is not easy to use, I have read many articles, websites, cpp files in order to understand them.  
The codes have been documented well and should be easily understand.  
This whole year at imperial college london has been a fantastic journey, I met new friends, met good teachers, learnt a lot knowledge. I am realdy for my next adventure.
